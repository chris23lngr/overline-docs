  Before you start creating your first landing page, you should have gone
  through the installation steps and understood how Overline is structured.
</Callout>

Awesome! So let's start creating your first page:

1. Create a file called `Landing.tsx` in your `/pages`- Folder.

2. Export a Component called `LandingPage` from the file that you just created:

   ```tsx filename="Landing.tsx"
   import React from "react";

   export const LandingPage: React.FC = () => {
     return <></>;
   };

   export default LandingPage;
   ```

3. Now you can start assembling your site from the prefabricated components.

   For example, you can use the Hero section from the Default template and the Features section from the Fourth template. It would look like this:

   ```tsx filename="Landing.tsx"{2-3, 8-9}
   import React from "react";
   import LandingDefaultHero from "./Landings/LandingDefault/LandingDefaultHero";
   import LandingFourFeatures from "./Landings/LandingFour/LandingFourFeatures";

   export const LandingPage: React.FC = () => {
     return (
       <>
         <LandingDefaultHero />
         <LandingFourFeatures />
       </>
     );
   };

   export default LandingPage;
   ```

4. Now add your page with an appropriate path to routes-array in `main.tsx`:

   ```tsx filename="main.tsx"
   // ...
   const router = createBrowserRouter([
     {
       path: "/",
       element: <App />,
       errorElement: <ErrorDefaultPage />,
     },
     {
        path: "/mypage":
        element: <LandingPage />
     },
     // other pages...
   ]);
   // ...
   ```

5. If you now start your server with `yarn run dev` and navigate in your browser to [localhost:5173/mypage](http://localhost:5173/mypage), you should see your newly assembled page.

6. One thing you should have noticed by now is that your texts are not yet customized. For example, go to the `LandingDefaultHero.tsx` file and change the text attributes:

   ```tsx filename="LandingDefaultHero.tsx" {3, 10}
   // ...
   <SectionHeader
     headline="This is a great website!"
     subHeadline="Simplify your data backup and storage process with our cloud-based
            solution. Our platform allows businesses of all sizes to securely
            store and manage their data in the cloud."
     variant="main"
     overline="The best Saas"
     ctaBtn={{
       title: "See our prices",
       target: "_blank",
       onClick: () => alert("Hello World"),
     }}
     secondaryBtn={{
       title: "Secondary Button",
       target: "_blank",
       href: "https://google.com",
     }}
   />
   // ...
   ```

   If you now go into you browser, you should instantly see your changes.
