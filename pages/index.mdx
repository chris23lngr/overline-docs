# Introduction

> Overline is a React template built with tailwindcss. The template is perfect for SaaS companies that want to invest less time in designing a landing page and more in developing a special project.

<br />

Thanks for choosing Overline as the template for your next React site. We have put
a lot of effort into making the template as easy to set up and use as possible. However,
you should have a quick browse through the documentation to understand how the template
is built. Here are a few good places to start:

<br />
<br />
import {
  BeakerIcon,
  RectangleGroupIcon,
  RocketLaunchIcon,
} from "@heroicons/react/24/solid";
import Cards from "../components/Cards";
import Card from "../components/Card";

<Cards num={3}>
  <Card icon={RocketLaunchIcon} href="/projectSetup" title="Getting started" />
  <Card
    icon={BeakerIcon}
    href="/themeConfiguration"
    title="Theme Configuration"
  />
  <Card icon={RectangleGroupIcon} href="/typography" title="Components" />
</Cards>
