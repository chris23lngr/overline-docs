# Editor Setup

Overline doesn't bring any presets for development environments, so you can work exactly as you are already used to from other projects.

However, we recommend including extensions like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) or [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) in your project,
as they provide consistency, which is very helpful when collaborating with other
people on a project.

  If you haven't already, you might want to checkout the [Tailwindcss VS-Code
  Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss),
  which makes life a lot easier!
