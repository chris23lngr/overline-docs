# Configuring the theme

Overline is based on Tailwindcss and therefore basicly uses the same methods to customize the theme.
Still, there are a few cases, where you might want to check out the overline docs, to get a better
understanding of how things work.

import {
  EyeDropperIcon,
  DocumentTextIcon,
} from "@heroicons/react/24/solid";
import Cards from "../components/Cards";
import Card from "../components/Card";

<Cards num={2}>
  <Card
    icon={EyeDropperIcon}
    href="/themeConfiguration/colors"
    title="Color Settings"
  />
  <Card
    icon={DocumentTextIcon}
    href="/themeConfiguration/fonts"
    title="Font Settings"
  />
</Cards>

In general, though, you should check out the [Tailwindcss documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). There you will find detailed explanations on how to best set up your project.
